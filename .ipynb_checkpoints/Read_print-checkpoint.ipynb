'' 1 -rrb- how long can they take to refund us our money ? 2 -rrb- do we have any legal recourse in getting our money sooner ? if the seller instructed her agent to take care of paying us , but now he 's deferring back to her , who actually bears responsibility for paying us our money ? 3 -rrb- does our agent and/or his broker bear any responsibility for not insisting that the terms of repayment were included in the sales contract ?\n",

      "content:  the demand letter was s a policy limits demand . the insurance company has an obligation to settle within policy limits so as not to expose its insured you to verdicts over the policy amounts . it is a tactic used by plaintiffs because a carrier who receives such a letter but fails to offer the full amount of the policy is liable for overage if the case goes to trial . your carrier appears to have offered the limits . whether they remain obligated to give you a defense even if they do n't have to pay any overage depends on the policy language and ca state law . there should have been a letter that contained the phrase reservation of rights that addressed this . most plaintiff 's attorneys are not interested in going after a defendant 's personal assets unless the defendant 1 has something worth pursuing and 2 did something egregious meaning nasty deliberate heartless etc. . asking for an affidavit of your assets is a fair thing for a plaintiff 's attorney to request . the first question you should be asking the lawyer is to confirm he is representing your interests as well as those of the insurance company . if he says yes and gives you a letter that says so you are likely okay listening to his instructions . if you are not sure hire a lawyer directly to tell you all this . that way you are sure of their loyalty and information . depending on the policy language it is possible the carrier may even pay their bill . if you need to know how to find someone competent let me know and i will explain how you can do it even while n active duty . this situation is relatively common . insurance defense lawyers deal with it frequently as do plaintiff lawyers who get the larger cases . there are a couple other issues that your original post raises some involving rights and obligation for people on active duty a possibility of mistake of service of process and a question whether the plaintiff is also pursuing your dad 's business but these are things your own attorney would clarify and advise you about .\n",
