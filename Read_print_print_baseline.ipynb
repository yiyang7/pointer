'' 1 -rrb- how long can they take to refund us our money ? 2 -rrb- do we have any legal recourse in getting our money sooner ? if the seller instructed her agent to take care of paying us , but now he 's deferring back to her , who actually bears responsibility for paying us our money ? 3 -rrb- does our agent and/or his broker bear any responsibility for not insisting that the terms of repayment were included in the sales contract ?\n",

'' with a shit eating grin on his face . the teacher obviously knew it was him . the revenge : unfortunately for trevor , his dad was one of the gym teachers . and as we all know , teachers talk . the spanish teacher got trevor 's dad to unlock his truck during school so that she could get revenge on him . they took those glass stink bomb things that you can buy in gas stations and break them on the floor . i thought the sandwich was bad , but oh dear lord , those stink bombs wreaked . they made you fucking gag after just one whiff . our teacher took 4 of those little bastards and broke them all in a styrofoam cup . she then placed it underneath trevor 's passenger seat in his truck . he would come to class everyday bitching about how he had to leave the windows down at all times and spray liberal amounts of febreeze . this dumb shit did n't find out the source until about a week after . all of the spanish teachers would stop trevor in the hallway and ask him , `` what stinks trevor ?

'' some people in the congregation looked up , anxiety and worry shot across their collective faces . alas they not only remained seated , but bowed their heads once more because the prayer had not been finished . the preacher did not even acknowledge the woman . mind you , this is why i mentioned it was a small church . the hysterical woman and the pastor were within 10 feet of one another . as the prayer went on , she became more hysterical . her husband became white , and was leaning against her grasping his heart . she held his head close against her chest as she continued crying out . the pastor continued prayer for three fucking minutes , taking a nice , drawn out breath between each line . not even looking up at her once . upon `` amen , '' people scattered . some ran to the phones , some ran to get water . others went to help the poor guy . come to find out he had a major heart attack . i do n't know if he survived it , as i never saw him or his family in church again . edit for years i could not understand why nobody reached out to help . it was an evil mixture of the bystander effect , group think and social pressure .\n",

'' the culture you produce each turn is added to a total for your civilization . as it reaches certain levels , you are allowed to adopt new social policies . each policy gives you small bonuses , like trading posts producing science or military units gaining additional experience in combat . there are 8 trees containing 5 each of these small policies , each with it 's own theme . adopting all policies in a tree typically grants some extra bonus on top of those you receive from the policies themselves . you always receive bonuses from policies you 've adopted . the tech tree and unit roster have been simplified . not by much , but they are noticeably smaller than those of civ iv . also new in civ 5 are city states . as their name implies , these are cities that behave like other civilizations , but do not expand and can not win the game . they will trade resources with you , can gift you units , and will declare war on enemies if they 're your ally . resources have been revamped as well . now , developing strategic resources yields multiple of the resource in each tile developed . you `` spend '' one of these resources for each unit you field that requires the resource . if i build an iron mine that yields 4 iron , for example , i could produce 4 swordsman . you can still trade them the same way . there is no espionage or religion in the base game . these mechanics are introduced in the gods and kings expansion , and are also different from what they were in civ iv .\n",

'' what ?? you do n't have any control over your dog ? i do n't say this to him , but i 'm losing patience . it took more than ten minutes to get my pouch back . which i did by shadowing the dog , but not showing it any attention until he lost interest . the guy then asks me to grab his dog , which i do . he says `` oh yeah , did n't my dog grab something else of yours once ?

      "content:  there are a lot of `` pop history '' books out there that try to make out that the black death was solely responsible for the death of feudalism . this is a little simplistic view on things , but it does contain a seed of truth . military feudal obligations , which were the true heart of the feudal system , were already well on their way out . what the black death achieved was an acceleration of the existing trend of the collapse of villeinage . make no mistake , the effects were readily noticeable , even at the time . a number of statutes were written with the intent to `` roll-back '' the shift in power back away from the labourer class , either by mandating that they accept pre-plague pay or by restricting free movement of labourers looking for better terms of employment . some of these were more successful than others , but in the end the rents paid by tenant farmers fell by more than a third , popular revolts kept the worst of the oppression at bay , and wages overall continued to rise steadily . the other major effect i occasionally see attributed to the black death is the rise of protestantism . the argument goes that since the church proved ineffective in ending the scourge , faith in the institution took a severe hit . this was compounded by the fact that the clergy themselves were disproportionately affected by the plague - they were the ones responsible for ministering to the sick and dying , and were more likely than the average citizen to put their trust in god and reach out to their fellow men in times of need . the resulting shortage of trained and pious clergy then provided opportunities for less scrupulous or educated men to get appointed . i would n't want to dismiss the narrative out of hand , but it 's a little bit pat . there was a lot going on during that period , and trying to nail down such a sweeping movement to a single cause is about as reductionist as you can get .\n",
