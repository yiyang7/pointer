      "content:  i finished the game i think my time was between 60 70 hours . my favourite part was the combat . i thought it was quite fun to completely customize how i wanted to play in my case i was a soldier with cryo powers typically reserved for engineers so i 'd freeze people and shatter them with melee or use a high power shotgun to blast my way through enemies . lots of customization in the combat gear which was nice . the jetpack was an ok addition to the combat formula and it allowed me to be a little more creative in fights . my least favourite part was that it was open world . coming from the original trilogy i felt the story characters and writing as a whole suffered because of the open world nature of the game . the pacing was strange and i found myself spending way too much time driving around on planets being bored and fighting repetitively spawning enemies as i was trying to complete any sidequests i decided to pick up . a couple of the side quests are interesting but the slog to get through them diminishes the enjoyment . as well there are many many required and repeated transitions from planet to planet sometimes for things as simple as go talk to this guy or talk to party member on your ship . i have a bloody computer strapped to my wrist can i not just facecam instead of travelling halfway across the cluster some of the story missions themselves are fairly good the standout for me being liam 's loyalty . the character himself kind of falls flat and he does n't seem to really have any redeeming qualities to me . similar things can be said about pretty much all of the characters and as a whole they do n't feel as memorable as the characters from the original trilogy . pretty good romance scenes with some of the characters though if you 're into that .\n",
